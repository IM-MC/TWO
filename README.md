# TWO

A fun side project made to allow collaborative efforts for those undergoing intermittent fasting. 
Because fasting with Two is better than one!

An aspect of the app involves picking a food (currently only popsicle) which you ‘defeat’. As your fast progresses, your selected food will slowly be consumed as a result of you ‘defeating’ your food choice!

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind this app stemmed from the fact that doing activities with others helps improve consistency. A good example of this is when individuals work out together and it helps them keep each other in check to make sure neither of them is slacking on their work outs. The main purpose of this app follows the same concept. If you can track your friend’s fast, it will hopefully help the user continue their fasting habits as well!
